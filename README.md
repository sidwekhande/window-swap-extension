# window-swap-extension
Google chrome extension to WindowSnap (https://window-swap.com/)

Installation: 

A. From zip file:
  i. Download and unzip file
  ii. Go to chrome://extensions/, choose "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped directory
  iii. Use window icon to reload new window :) 
  
A known bug: Extension does not work on new/blank Chrome tab, will only work on tab that has content on it. Advice would be appreciated! :)
